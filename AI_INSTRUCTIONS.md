Work on tasks in `./tasks`.
If you are confused, read @CONTRIBUTING.md or @README.md
Determine if you can validate the task's success criteria on your own. You can build and run nvim from a clean start using Docker.
If you don't have enough information to validate the task's success criteria, then update the tasks with a Pending Questions section and move on to another task.
If you can't validate the tasks success criteria because you need a human, move the task to `./manual_tasks`. Then move on to another task.
If you complete a task, add all files with `git add -A` and commit then with `git commit -m 'task x complete'` (but use a better message.)
