# Task 11: Implement Mapping Conflict Detection

## Description

As more plugins and custom configurations are added, the risk of key mapping conflicts increases. A conflict occurs when two different plugins or configurations attempt to map the same key sequence to different actions. This can lead to confusing and unpredictable behavior.

The goal of this task is to create a system or tool to detect and report on these mapping conflicts.

## Plan

1.  **Research Existing Tools**: Investigate if there are existing Neovim plugins designed specifically for detecting mapping conflicts. A popular choice might be `folke/which-key.nvim` itself, which has features to detect and warn about overridden mappings.
2.  **Develop a Custom Solution (if needed)**:
    -   If no suitable tool exists, a custom Lua script could be developed.
    -   This script would iterate through all active keymaps after Neovim has started (`:h nvim_get_keymap()`).
    -   It would build a data structure that groups mappings by mode and key sequence.
    -   If any group contains more than one mapping, it signifies a conflict.
3.  **Implement Reporting**:
    -   The results should be presented to the user in a clear format.
    -   This could be a custom command (e.g., `:CheckMappings`) that opens a new buffer or prints a report listing the conflicting keys, their modes, and the commands they are mapped to.
    -   For a more proactive approach, this check could be integrated into the `oathealth` plugin to run as part of the health check.
4.  **Document the Solution**: Add documentation for the new tool, explaining how to run it and interpret the results.
