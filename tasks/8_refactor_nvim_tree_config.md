# Task 8: Refactor nvim-tree Configuration

## Description

Currently, some or all of the keymap configurations for the `nvim-tree` plugin are located in the main `init.lua` file. To improve modularity and adhere to the "configuration as plugins" principle, this configuration should be moved to its own pack-specific config file.

The goal of this task is to relocate the `nvim-tree` keymap setup from `init.lua` to `pack/nvim-tree/start/nvim-tree-config/plugin/nvim-tree-config.lua`.

## Plan

1.  **Identify `nvim-tree` Config**: Locate the `nvim-tree` setup block and any related keymappings in `init.lua`.
2.  **Move Configuration**: Cut the identified configuration code from `init.lua`.
3.  **Paste into Pack Config**: Paste the code into the `nvim-tree-config.lua` file.
4.  **Ensure Correctness**: Make sure the setup code is still valid and doesn't rely on any variables that were local to `init.lua`. The `nvim-tree-config.lua` file should contain the complete, self-contained configuration for the plugin.
5.  **Test**: Restart Neovim and verify that all `nvim-tree` functionality and keymaps work as expected.
