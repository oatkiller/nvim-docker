# Task 7: Update Documentation for All Packs

## Description

The documentation for the various plugin packs is incomplete. To ensure the configuration is easy to understand and maintain, each pack should have corresponding documentation.

The goal of this task is to review every pack and create or update its documentation file in `nvim-config/doc/`, following the established format.

## Plan

1.  **Review Existing Packs**: List all the packs currently in the `pack/` directory.
2.  **Audit Documentation**: For each pack, check if a corresponding help file exists in `nvim-config/doc/`.
3.  **Create/Update Documentation**:
    -   For packs without documentation, create a new help file (e.g., `nvim-config/doc/pack-name.txt`).
    -   For packs with outdated documentation, update the existing file.
    -   Each file should include:
        -   A help tag (e.g., `*oatvim-pack-name*`).
        -   A brief description of the pack's purpose.
        -   A list of the plugins included in the pack.
        -   An explanation of the custom configurations and keymappings.
        -   Links to the original plugin documentation.
4.  **Update Main Help File**: Add links to the new or updated help tags in the main `oatvim.txt` help file to ensure they are discoverable.
